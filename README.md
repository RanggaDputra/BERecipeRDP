## Description
The Recipe Backend is the core component of our app responsible for the business logic and data management of recipes. It is a powerful part of the system that allows us to provide users with fast and reliable access to the latest and favorite recipes.

## Feature
The MyRecipe API has several features, namely :
* Recipe API: The backend provides a powerful application programming interface (API) for managing recipes, including creating, editing, deleting, and retrieving recipes.
* User Management: Support for user management, including authentication, authorization, and user profile management. 
* Database: The backend uses a database to store recipes, users, and other related data. We optimize database performance and security.
* Security: Data and access security is prioritized, including data encryption, multi-factor authentication, and protection against attacks.
* Error Handling: The backend comes with robust error handling and logging for easy troubleshooting.
	
## Build With
This application was created using : 
* Programming Language: Our backend is developed using a programming language (Node.js, etc.).
* Framework: We use frameworks (such as Express.js, etc.) to speed up development.
* Database: Our databases are built using technologies such as PostgreSQL.
* Cyclic for Deploy
